# ProjectAvatar
### The project started off after our initial project idea was rejected and upon seeing our options, we were inspired by the default maze game project but instead we wanted to create our own game and understand the game development process from start to finish and understand was has come to make our favorite game such as Minecraft, Street fighter and so many more.
